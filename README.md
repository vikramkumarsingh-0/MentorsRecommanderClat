Absolutely! Based on your updated Streamlit code and recommendation logic, here's an updated and **scalable** version of the `README.md` with future-proof structure and aligned to your current implementation.

# 🧑‍⚖️ CLAT Mentor Recommendation System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Design a simple ML-based system to recommend mentors (CLAT toppers) to aspirants based on user profiles and preferences.

---

## 💡 Approach

This project implements a **rule-based content filtering system** to recommend mentors who best match an aspirant’s preferences. It uses keyword matching and scoring techniques for subjects, colleges, and learning styles to compute a **match score**, which ranks mentors based on relevance.

The app is built using **Streamlit** for easy interactivity and deployment.

---

## 📂 Deliverables

### ✅ 1. Data Handling
- Loads **mock mentor data** from a CSV file.
- Mentor profiles include:
  - `Name`
  - `Expertise` (CLAT subjects)
  - `Alma Mater`
  - `Teaching Approach`

### ✅ 2. Aspirant Preferences
From the sidebar, users can select:
- **Preferred Subjects** (e.g., Legal Reasoning, English)
- **Target Colleges** (e.g., NLSIU, NALSAR)
- **Learning Styles** (e.g., Visual, Auditory)

### ✅ 3. Recommendation Logic
- Each mentor is assigned a **Match Score** based on:
  - Number of overlapping preferred subjects.
  - College match.
  - Teaching style alignment.
- **Top 3 mentors** are recommended based on the highest match scores.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- ✅ **Scalable Filtering Logic**: Built with modular filters for subjects, colleges, and learning styles — easy to add new ones.
- 🔄 **Feedback Loop Integration**: Add user ratings for each recommendation to enhance mentor ranking.
- 🧠 **Hybrid ML Model**: Combine current system with collaborative filtering or embedding-based similarity for smarter recommendations.
- 📝 **User Profiles**: Allow users to create/save profiles for personalized suggestions over time.
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard**: Track mentor performance, engagement, and recommendation trends.

---

## 📊 Bonus: How the System Learns

With user interaction over time, the system can:
- Use feedback (likes/dislikes) to adjust mentor rankings.
- Learn feature importance (e.g., if learning style is more critical than college).
- Incorporate **semantic embeddings** (e.g., sentence transformers) for fuzzy and context-aware matching.

### ✨ Sample Mentor Output

| Name        | Expertise                 | Alma Mater | Teaching Approach     |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A. Sharma   | Legal Reasoning, English  | NLSIU       | Visual, Reading/Writing |
| B. Mehta    | GK, Logical Reasoning     | NALSAR      | Auditory, Visual      |

Would you like me to refactor and clean your code next for better modularity and future extensibility (e.g., introducing feedback loop or ML models later)?
